					"LOGEX has been the cornerstone of my career since my early college years, marking the inception of a transformative journey. Joining the company a mere year after its birth, my initial mission was nothing short of monumental—shaping the evolution of legacy AngularJS code into its modern successor.",
					"In my first year, I embraced the role of a technical lead, entrusted with one of the company's lesser-known products. This experience proved invaluable, imparting profound lessons on the significance of adopting the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach and the fine art of crafting scalable code. This formative period propelled me through the ranks of software development at an impressive pace.",
					"Subsequently, I embarked on a profound and transformative journey, deeply immersed in crafting a custom framework that stood as the bedrock for all our products. As a key member of the core development team during this era, I shouldered multifaceted responsibilities, tackling internationalization, navigating numerous rebranding initiatives, and pioneering test automation, all while donning the mantle of a product tech lead.",
					"Beyond the realm of coding, my engagement extended to HR activities. I was instrumental in designing the entire interview process and played a pivotal role in the onboarding and mentoring of new developers entering the company's fold.",
					"Over the course of my tenure, the company experienced a remarkable metamorphosis, expanding from a team of 40 to a workforce of 300 and extending its operations from one country to six. I was privileged to be an integral member of the core team that spearheaded and facilitated these profound changes, amassing invaluable insights and wisdom along the way."

Remarkably, my previous employer had such trust in my abilities that he approached me with an opportunity at a company established by one of his acquaintances.",
					"Upon my entry into the company, the architectural aspect was not given significant attention. This was primarily due to the pressing need to swiftly deliver a multitude of features in their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) state, with the primary goal of generating revenue.",
					"I played a pivotal role in addressing these challenges. My contributions encompassed a comprehensive overhaul, including the rebranding and architectural enhancements of the frontend. I spearheaded the transformation of the backend, shifting it closer to a domain-driven design paradigm. Additionally, I took charge of mobile app development, ensuring a holistic approach to improving the company's technical landscape.",
					"Beyond my coding responsibilities, I took the initiative to create a structured onboarding program tailored for both interns and developers. Moreover, I actively engaged in representing the company at public events, contributing to its promotion and outreach efforts.",
					"At Level, I experienced a profound moment of recognition, perhaps the most significant in my life thus far. A departing colleague paid me the highest compliment, stating: \"Of all the developers I've worked with, Šimon definitely has the deepest knowledge of JavaScript\""
